        After updating it on Discord you can get it updated without delay by
        logging out and logging back in (on sendou.ink - not Discord).
        Additionally if you want to have your avatar automatically update make
        sure you are on Sendou&apos;s Discord server. This way your avatar will
        be automatically updated periodically.
